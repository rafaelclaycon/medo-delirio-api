## How to run this project

To build and run this project, you'll need:

- A Mac running macOS 12 Monterey or newer;
- Xcode 13.4+;
- admin privileges on the Mac's user account to run and bind the server to the 8080 port.

That's it.

## üöß Known glaring shortcoming üöß

This project does not use random access tokens or any other client-server communication security measure. This is a small project coded by just me (a mostly front-end person) and no personal life-threatening information is sent back and forth.

That said, if you want to help make this better, you're more than welcome to do so by opening a pull request (let's see some code!).
