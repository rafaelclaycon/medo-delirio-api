## How to run this project

To build and run this project, you'll need:

- A Mac running macOS 13.5 Ventura or later;
- Xcode 15.2 or later;
- admin privileges on the Mac's user account to run and bind the server to the 8080 port.

That's it.

## Curious about how this runs?

This is an API built for the [Medo e Del√≠rio iOS app](https://github.com/rafaelclaycon/MedoDelirioBrasilia) written in 100% Swift that relies on the [Vapor framework](https://vapor.codes) to work. It runs on a Linux VM (Ubuntu to be specific) that costs me just 5 Dollars a month and serves an average of 5,000 unique monthly users, sync system and all. I think that's pretty neat.

## üöß Work in Progress üöß

This project does not use random access tokens or any other client-server communication security measure. This is a small project coded by just me (a mostly front-end person) and no personal life-threatening information is sent back and forth. I do plan on adding HTTPS support in the near future.

That said, if you want to help make this better, you're more than welcome to do so by opening a pull request (let's see some code!).
